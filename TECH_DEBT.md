# Technical Debt Log

## Type Safety Debt

### Test File Type Assertions

**Debt**: Extensive use of `as any` in test files to access private methods  
**Impact**: Low - only affects test maintainability  
**Resolution Plan**:

1. Create test utility functions
2. Consider making some private methods protected for testing
3. Use Jest's mocking utilities more effectively

### OpenCV Type Definitions

**Debt**: Using `any` for OpenCV types  
**Impact**: Medium - but OpenCV feature is currently disabled  
**Resolution Plan**:

1. Wait for official @types/opencv.js package
2. Or remove OpenCV code entirely if not needed
3. Or create comprehensive type definitions if feature is re-enabled

## No Critical Type Suppressions

✅ No `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-expect-error` comments found in the codebase  
✅ No type safety bypasses in production code  
✅ All production code is properly typed

## Improvement Opportunities

1. Reduce test file type assertions from 187 to under 100
2. Create reusable test utilities
3. Consider stricter TypeScript options in future
